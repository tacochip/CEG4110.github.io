# Weekly Team Report

## Week 1:
### Progress Report: 
On the first week, a group workspace was created through Slack containing channels that were advised to be included by the instructor. Each team member was added and disclosed their availability throughout the week. Our group concluded that the best days to meet would be Tuesday and Thursday during classtime, with additional time to be taken at 5 p.m. on Tuesdays if needed.

## Week 2:
Our team began our project by creating our team website through Github Pages (this site) and our private repository also through Github. Teamates got to know one another, discussed other possible meeting times, and discussed the overall flow we would like to follow for the remainder of the semester. The base necessary sections were added to the website and all team members were added as collaborators on both the team website and the private repo. Once intialized, both the link to our website and an invite to the private repo were submitted to the instructor via direct message on Slack. 

## Week 3:
Our team acknowledged the due dates for the requirements spreadsheet and requirements presenation and began deciding what our top five requirements would be for this project. Once decided, we began by listing our top five requirements on the spreadsheet template and at least two sub-requirements for each. After filling in the sections on the spreadsheet that could be addressed with our current progress, we began creating our top five requirements presenation using the provided template.

## Week 4:
This week, our work mainly consisted of polishing our requirements documents from our most recent meetings. This included listing every possible test case we could come up with on our presentation, adding in testers and developers on the spreadsheet, and figuring out our test descriptions for each requirement and sub-requirement. After completing both documents to our fullest ability with the current state of our project, both documents were submitted via direct message on Slack to the instructor.
