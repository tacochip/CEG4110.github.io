# Weekly Team Report

## Week 1:
### Progress Report: 
On the first week, a group workspace was created through Slack containing channels that were advised to be included by the instructor. Each team member was added and disclosed their availability throughout the week. Our group concluded that the best days to meet would be Tuesday and Thursday during classtime, with additional time to be taken at 5 p.m. on Tuesdays if needed.

### Number of Meetings: 0

### Group Work-Hours: 0

## Week 2:
### Progress Report:
Our team began our project by creating our team website through Github Pages (this site) and our private repository also through Github. Teamates got to know one another, discussed other possible meeting times, and discussed the overall flow we would like to follow for the remainder of the semester. The base necessary sections were added to the website and all team members were added as collaborators on both the team website and the private repo. Once intialized, both the link to our website and an invite to the private repo were submitted to the instructor via direct message on Slack. 

### Number of Meetings: 1

### Group Work-Hours: 2

## Week 3:
### Progress Report:
Our team acknowledged the due dates for the requirements spreadsheet and requirements presenation and began deciding what our top five requirements would be for this project. Once decided, we began by listing our top five requirements on the spreadsheet template and at least two sub-requirements for each. After filling in the sections on the spreadsheet that could be addressed with our current progress, we began creating our top five requirements presenation using the provided template.

### Number of Meetings: 2

### Group Work-Hours: 3

## Week 4:
### Progress Report:
This week, our work mainly consisted of polishing our requirements documents from our most recent meetings. This included listing every possible test case we could come up with on our presentation, adding in testers and developers on the spreadsheet, and figuring out our test descriptions for each requirement and sub-requirement. After completing both documents to our fullest ability with the current state of our project, both documents were submitted via direct message on Slack to the instructor. 

### Number of Meetings: 2

### Group Work-Hours: 3

## Week 5:
### Progress Report:
On the fifth week of work, our team began figuring out how we were going to approach the next objective; Creating a fully functional front end by October 16th. The software that we had previously chosen to use already included a login system, user management, and a feature to create pages and manage who has access to them. The work conducted mainly consisted of research and summing up what pages needed to be included and the UI for each page. 

### Number of Meetings: 1

### Group Work-Hours: 2

## Week 6:
### Progress Report:
After referring to the conclusions from the previous week, our group spent this meeting creating a full front-end. This included a schedule query page, faculty approve/deny page, and a page where the student can add/drop classes per the semester of their choice. The rest of our time met was dedicated to figuring out how we will transfer class data, student input, and faculty-student cases between pages through the back-end. 

### Number of Meetings: 1

### Group Work-Hours: 2

## Week 7:
### Progress Report:
With the upcoming mid-term demonstration day, our group polished our front-end and made sure it met all requirements concerning the front-end of the design project. This included establishing a password-lockout function on the login page, editing previous pages to be webforms to allow for easier selection and UI, and providing quick-links on user pages to grant easy access to required webforms. 
 
### Number of Meetings: 2

### Group Work-Hours: 3

## Week 8:
### Progress Report: 
This week contained the "mid-term demo day". Our group had already established a solid front-end for our website and decided on Tuesday that we were fully ready to present the following Thursday. On Thursday, our project website was presented to Sean Banerjee and received light constructive criticism that offered new insight to how we will construct our back-end information flow. No further work was completed after presenting the project. 
 
### Number of Meetings: 0

### Group Work-Hours: 0

## Week 9:
### Progress Report: 
The week following the mid-term, our group began constructing our back-end and information transfer. This included a constructing a notification system, working on webform logic, and installing appropriate plugins on Drupal that perform certain functions needed for course logic. Seeing as this was the first week fully concentrating on the back-end, our group dedicated more time to fully understand how we will go about constructing the rest of our website rather than implementing functions right away. 

### Number of Meetings: 2

### Group Work-Hours: 3

## Week 10:
### Progress Report: 
The work continued this week with our notification system and webform logic. A faculty notification system was created which displays student submissions in descending chronological order. Our group utilized the Drupal "Views" structure to create content blocks that appear on specific user pages. For example, the "Faculty Notification" block was restricted to the home pages of users under the "faculty" role. 

### Number of Meetings: 2

### Group Work-Hours: 3

## Week 11:
### Progress Report:
Our team spent this week focusing on updating student information and creating two Student Notification blocks. The first block displays current student submissions (if they require approval). The second displays the result of the approval process after it has been reviewed. In regards to student information, our group was simply making sure the student's major, minor, co-op request, and credit hours are updated on their student information page every time they make a new submission. 

### Number of Meetings: 2

### Group Work-Hours: 3

## Week 12: check 14
### Progress Report: This week, our group began our schedule generation logic as well as the SRS document. Schedule generation work included getting our own SSH keys to work within the Drupal project, developing code, and practicing implementation on the website. The SRS document began construction but was not complete. 


### Number of Meetings: 1

### Group Work-Hours: 2

## Week 13:
### Progress Report: Team 1 continued to work on the schedule generation logic as well as the SRS document. The SRS document was mostly completed with the last two sections being left blank. The bulk of the document was within the "System Features" section, which was completed. On the other side of the project, the schedule generation logic was continually worked on throughout the week with ample progress being made. 


### Number of Meetings: 2

### Group Work-Hours: 3

## Week 14: **Thanksgiving Week**
### Progress Report: Our group only met one time this week due to Thanksgiving Break the following Thursday from our Tuesday meeting. In this meeting, the SRS document was fully complete and the work on the schedule generation algorithm began to come to a close. Work to be done includes; Polishing website, proofreading/editing SRS document, and checking test cases once the algorithm is complete.


### Number of Meetings: 1

### Group Work-Hours: 2

## Week 15:
### Progress Report: This week began rough with a snow day on what was supposed to be our first of two meetings. Starting Thursday, our group finally wrapped up our schedule generation logic and implemented it into our project website. We also proofread our SRS and decided to remove a few things that we didn't end up implementing, such as certain warning or error messages. Team 1 plans on making sure our test cases work and the UI of the website is smooth before our demo-day a week from this Thursday.

# Project Overview
This project is a Drupal-based academic schedule generation portal designed to streamline how students plan and obtain approval for their semester schedules. The system allows students to enter key academic preferences—including major(s), minor(s), co-op participation, and desired credit hour load—and automatically generates an optimized course schedule based on institutional rules, program requirements, and course availability.
The portal centralizes what is normally a manual, advisor-driven process. By integrating dynamic forms, automated validation logic, and role-based workflows, the system ensures that schedule submissions meet academic guidelines while still providing flexibility. Students requesting exceptions—such as enrolling in fewer than 11 or more than 20 credit hours, or adding a co-op term—are automatically routed to faculty for review. Once approved, the system updates the student’s generated schedule accordingly.
Overall, the goal of this project is to deliver a user-friendly scheduling tool that reduces administrative overhead, increases accuracy in academic planning, and improves the student advising experience through automation and intelligent workflow design.
